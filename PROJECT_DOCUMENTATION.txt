Project Repository: shinchronize
Status: Active Development


1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
===================

Project Name: EvolvEd (codebase also referred to as Shinchronize)

Purpose and Problem It Solves:
EvolvEd transforms traditional campus placement systems into a continuous growth platform.

7. AI / PARSING LOGIC
======================

RESUME PARSING APPROACH:

Text Extraction:
- Uses pdf-parse npm package to extract text from PDF buffer
- Handles page-by-page parsing concatenating all text content
- Strips special characters and normalizes whitespace
- Checks for empty PDFs and image-based PDFs with no extractable text

AI Parsing with Groq:
- Sends extracted text to Groq llama-3.3-70b-versatile model
- Structured prompt requests JSON response with specific fields
- Fields include fullName, email, phone, location, headline, summary, skills array, college, branch, graduationYear, cgpa, linkedinUrl, githubUrl, portfolioUrl, projects array, certifications array
- Prompt instructs AI to use null for missing fields and normalize URLs
- Temperature set to 0.3 for more deterministic extraction
- Max tokens 2000 to allow comprehensive parsing
- Response parsing includes JSON extraction from markdown code blocks if AI wraps response
- Error handling for malformed JSON responses

Data Transformation:
- Full name split into firstName and lastName
- CGPA normalized to 10-point scale if percentage provided
- URLs validated and normalized to full format
- Skills deduplicated and trimmed
- Projects transformed into subdocument schema with title, description, githubLink, tags, status set to pending
- Certifications transformed into subdocument schema with name, provider, issuedDate, status set to pending

Profile Update Logic:
- Existing profile fields updated only if parsed data contains non-null values
- Skills array replaces existing skills completely
- Projects and certifications appended to existing arrays rather than replacing
- Student document saved with all updates in single database operation
- Readiness score automatically recalculated after save due to model hooks

GITHUB DATA PROCESSING:

Current State:
- No active GitHub API integration implemented
- GitHub URL stored as string field in profile
- Resume parser can extract GitHub URLs from resume text
- Project entries include optional GitHub repository link field

Intended Approach (Not Yet Implemented):
- Would use GitHub REST API or GraphQL API
- Would require GitHub personal access token for authentication
- Would fetch repository list for user
- Would extract repository names, descriptions, languages, star counts, fork counts
- Would analyze commit history for contribution frequency
- Would identify primary programming languages from repositories
- Would map repository topics to skills
- Would calculate contribution consistency score
- Would update readiness score based on GitHub activity

LINKEDIN HANDLING:

PDF Structure:
- LinkedIn PDF exports contain HTML-like structure with specific div classes
- Section headers follow predictable patterns such as About, Experience, Education, Skills
- cheerio library used to parse HTML structure from PDF text
- Selector patterns defined for name extraction, headline, summary, skills list, experience entries, education entries

Parsing Logic:
- Searches for LinkedIn-specific CSS selectors and class names
- Extracts name from h1 tags with specific classes
- Finds headline from profile top card sections
- Locates skills section and extracts individual skill names
- Parses experience entries with company, role, date range
- Parses education entries with institution, degree, field, dates
- Handles multiple date formats and text variations
- Truncates long text fields to prevent database bloat
- Cleans line breaks and normalizes whitespace

Current Issue:
- Module loading error with pdf-parse library import
- Error indicates package subpath not exported in package.json
- Likely version compatibility issue or ESM vs CommonJS mismatch
- Parsing logic exists but cannot execute at runtime
- Workaround requires updating pdf-parse version or import method

- Uses Groq llama-3.1-8b-instant model for real-time question generation
- Prompt includes role (Full-Stack Developer, Data Scientist, AI Engineer, Cloud Architect), level (Junior, Mid, Senior), current difficulty (easy, medium, hard, expert), focus areas (specific technologies or domains), question number in sequence
- Prompt requests MCQ format with single best answer and three distractors
- Temperature set to 0.7 for creative varied questions
- Max tokens 800 to allow detailed question and options
- Response parsed as JSON with question text, options array with keys A B C D, correct answer key

Difficulty Progression:
- Starts at medium difficulty for first question
- After each answer, evaluates rubric scores for clarity, technical accuracy, communication, relevance, confidence
- If overall rubric score above 7, increases difficulty one level
- If overall rubric score below 5, decreases difficulty one level
- Difficulty progression stored in session meta for tracking
- Prevents difficulty from dropping below easy or rising above expert

Answer Evaluation:
- Submits selected answer along with all options and question context to Groq
- Prompt includes rubric categories and scoring guidelines
- AI evaluates answer quality on scale of 0 to 10 for each rubric dimension
- Response parsed as JSON with rubric object and boolean isCorrect flag
- Rubric scores stored in turn subdocument
- Overall score calculated as average of rubric dimensions
- Learning curve graph point added after each evaluation

Summary Generation:
- After final question or session completion, sends all turns to Groq
- Prompt requests comprehensive summary analyzing performance trends, strengths, weaknesses, consistency
- Includes score percentage calculation from correct answer count
- Summary text stored in session document
- Summary displayed in interview history and recruiter dashboard

AI MENTOR SUGGESTIONS:

Context Building:
